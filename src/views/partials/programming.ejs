            I got into programming at 11, with Visual Basic. It took me several attempts at learning
            it enough by eavesdropping older people's classes (that was the only resource I had back
            then) to build a barebone GUI calculator application.

            I started learning Java in school since I was in the 8th grade, and kept writing school
            level Java programs until the end of school at 18.

            In grade 11 and 12, our computer teacher used to give a few of us separate class
            assignment questions than the others. Those were really challenging for us back then.
            Learnt about some standard Data Structures and Algorithms there.

            I wasn't particularly interested in solving abstract programming questions to run in a
            black & white terminal window. I wanted to build applications people could interact
            with.

            In the pursuit of building applications, I taught myself quite a few programming
            languages and tools. Over the years I've written some good amount of code in those, to
            build actual projects.
